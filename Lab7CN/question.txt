Simulate the Distance Vector Routing with randomly deployed 50 stations. 
Check for the Count â€“to-Infinity problem.  
If it is not existing, then impose the problem and 
then implement any two solutions to resolve the Count-to-Infinity problem 
occurred in the routing protocol. Run the simulation for 100secs. 
Measure and plot the network performance in terms of PDR, PLR, routing overhead 
and route reconstruction rate for every 10sec interval.

#Same code for DVR AND CTF. After running dvr, modify threshold value (From 32 to a larger value in rt_proto dv file) in source code to implement CTF.
